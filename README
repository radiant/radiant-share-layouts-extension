Allows Rails controllers/actions to use Radiant layouts as their "layout".  
content_for blocks are mapped to page parts, with the exception of :title and
:breadcrumbs, which map to their specific default tags. The default content, 
or @content_for_layout, is mapped to the 'body' part.

== What to do in your controllers

  radiant_layout 'Layout name'

-or-

  radiant_layout { |controller| # some code to determine layout name }

radiant_layout takes the same options as the built-in layout.  To specifically
override the Radiant layout and use a standard Rails one use 
:layout => "mine", or :layout => false for no layout, as options to render.

To choose a different Radiant layout, set the @radiant_layout instance 
variable to the name of a Radiant layout in your controller or view.
